# Dismiss Welcome Nag
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/luciano-croce/dismiss-welcome-nag.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/luciano-croce/dismiss-welcome-nag)

Dismiss "Welcome Panel" nag, dashboard widget, when is activated, or automatically, when put on mu-plugins directory.
* <strong>Tips</strong>: a neat trick is to <strong>put</strong> this single file <strong>dismiss-welcome-nag.php</strong> (not its parent directory) in the <strong>/wp-content/mu-plugins/</strong> directory (create it if not exists) so you won't even have to enable it, and will be loaded by default, also, since first step of installation!
